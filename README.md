This is a master's thesis made for the University of Gothenburg. The thesis research question was "Modeling personalities with believable and consistent behavior for NPCs in games using stealth gameplay style". In which, we have based our guard AI around paper's that delve into the personality, emotion, motivation and mood models and how they can be applied as AI algorithms. We then took whatever we felt could enhance the AI guard behavior in stealth games and made a prototype around it.

In this prototype demo you play as Fergus, a man who wakes up in the middle of a dark cellar in a pool of wine. He realizes he is in a very peculiar tower. Ascend with Fergus up the floors to discover the secrets of the tower while avoiding pesky ghost guards along the way. Don't let the similarities of the guards fool you. They have their own weaknesses and strengths and you as the player must try to understand in what they're weak against and what they're strong at. Progress through each level, and get a hit about what mysteries are behold in the tower.

This is a point and click stealth game. Simply click to move around and interact with objects. You can pick up objects and place them down by pressing E. You can also crouch at specified locations by pressing the right mouse button down.
